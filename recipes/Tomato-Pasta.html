            In a large, high-sided skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Cook onion, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Add tomato paste and stir to coat veggies. Add cherry tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until just starting to burst, about 5 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes, cream, and basil; season with salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened and slightly reduced, about 10 minutes.
